				<h2>Transformative Opportunities</h2>

				<p>
					Throughout my 23 years at UCF, one of my key goals has been student
					success and working to ensure that students who enter UCF are not
					the same students as they leave. Students should be wiser, more socially
					astute, diverse in their thinking and better prepared to build a brighter
					future for themselves and for our country and our world. Our learningcentered
					campus community offers enriching opportunities that
					prepare students to be bold, innovative and socially responsible.
					Students are encouraged to grow, succeed and excel.
				</p>

				<p>
					The Division of Student Development and Enrollment Services provides
					students with the opportunity to learn, lead, live and engage. We know
					that education has the power to transform lives and students have the
					opportunity to succeed, it changes not only their lives, but the lives of
					their families and those around them.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this year’s report – DREAM BIG – you’ll see many examples of how
					the division has successfully worked to improve the quality of the student
					experience. Thank you again for your continued support.
				</p>
				<p>
					The best is yet to come! <em>Go Knights! Charge On! </em>

					<em>“Tonight, let’s all say strongly, firmly, without reservation -- Black Lives Matter.” — John C. Hitt, UCF President</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					More than 500 students, staff, faculty and university leaders
					gathered on July 13 in the Student Union for the Black Lives
					Matter event. The focus of the event was to educate the community about
					the Black Lives Matter movement and to show solidarity for those
					affected by acts of senseless violence.
				</p>

				<p>
					UCF President John C. Hitt, First Lady Martha Hitt, Vice President
					Maribeth Ehasz and Athletics Director Danny White were among those
					who attended the Black Lives Matter vigil that was sponsored by several
					student groups. Members of UCF's Police Department marched in with
					the event organizers. President Hitt spoke during the peaceful event that
					featured students leading prayers, singing and sharing their thoughts as
					they questioned how the violence could have happened and what this
					means for our community.

				<p>
					Forty-nine innocent lives, including UCF Knights Juan Ramon
					Guerrero and Christopher Andrew Leinonen, were taken on June
					12 at the tragic Pulse nightclub shooting. Ramon Guerrero was a prefinance
					major and Leinonen earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees
					in Psychology. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The days following the Pulse nightclub tragedy were very challenging
					for our students, faculty and staff. It was stressful and tremendously
					emotional. However, in the midst of uncertainty, anger and confusion,
					our community showed love and courage. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To support our grieving campus community, we held numerous
					events to honor the lives of those lost and injured. UCF Counseling
					and Psychological Services and UCF Cares provided support services
					and triaged hundreds of calls, emails and face-to-face meetings from
					concerned and anxious parents and families.
